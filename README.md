(OARS) Orientation Awareness and Reaction Systems IMU and GPS data logger app
This program is currently in beta testing. App runs in "Manual" or "Automatic at startup" logging mode. 
It captures Accelerometer, Gyro, Magnetic, and GPS data to a SQLlite DB, and CSV file on internal or ExtSD card.
Currently works good in Manual mode, needs some refinement in automatic mode.
